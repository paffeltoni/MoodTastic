When the user enters a wrong email or password it just jumps into the register a user page, its like it
doesn't break

the hash for the password does not work in NetBeans

My script does not work in NetBeans for my responsive Nav

Still need to fix the error mssg for the add post page. 

  <?php if(isset($_SESSION['city_error'])): ?>    
            <p>
                <?= $_SESSION['city_error'];
                unset($_SESSION['city_error']);?>
            </p>      
        <?php endif ?>

php if statement to fix errors

**** Need to fix the showing of avatar - change the avatar upload to follow the way the post is uploaded

*** Need to fix the moon button for the responsivness of the app - its on the wrong side and it needs to be resized

After I add a post it brings me back to the manage posts tab but there is an error saying that the variable has been undifined for the foreach loop
same with all the other things i can add

add hover over effect for dashboard and log out- turn log out to a diff color the red is to much.

havnt done anything with edit category

also if a user has no posts make something say in error message instead of table table, user has no posts

figure out why the categories array is not showing the name of the category

I don't have a category page set up yet for my categories so there is the button that just stays on the same page
